# Fun translator

This app takes some text as input from the user then translates it according to character language. Suppose we want to translate some text to minion's language then

- We have to select the Minion option from the home page first.
- Then we have to enter our expected text in the textbox field.
- Then we have to submit the form then it will be translated by expected character language.
